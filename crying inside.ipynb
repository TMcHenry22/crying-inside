    "host, who knew where the most valuable item was, would open one of the doors\n",
    "not selected and reveal a worthless item.\n",

    "**The host would then offer to let the contestant select a different door from what was originally\n",
    "selected. The question, of course, is should the contestant switch?**\n",

    "Much interest in this problem was generated when it was analyzed by a popular magazine\n",
    "writer, Marilyn vos Savant, who concluded that the optimal strategy is to switch. This\n",
    "strategy is counterintuitive to many mathematicians, who would say that there is nothing to\n",
    "be gained by switching; that is, that the probability of improving the selection is 0.5. Study\n",
    "this problem by Monte Carlo methods. Be careful to understand all of the assumptions\n",
